# Papers

If I see a paper I like and think I can implemented it i'll will put it here.

## Current Papers

1. [Multi-Sample Dropout for Accelerated Training and Better Generalization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09788.pdf)

2. [Unsupervised Data Augmentation for Consistency Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.12848.pdf) [**Blog Post**](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/07/advancing-semi-supervised-learning-with.html?m=1)


## TODO

1. [An Intriguing Failing of Convolutional Neural Networks and the CoordConv Solution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03247)

2. [CutMix: Regularization Strategy to Train Strong Classifiers
with Localizable Features](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04899.pdf)
